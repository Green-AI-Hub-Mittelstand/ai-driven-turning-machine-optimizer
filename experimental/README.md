# Experimental

This folder contains scripts for estimating the lifetime of a tool. The project is in a prototype stage and has not been further developed.

## Contents

The scripts serve as a foundation for analyzing and calculating tool lifetime. They can be used as a starting point for further development or experimentation.

## Note

Since this is a prototype, the scripts may not be fully documented or optimized. Further development and adaptation to specific requirements are needed.
